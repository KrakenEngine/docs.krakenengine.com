## Work in progress

I've stripped out most of the template content and set up a rough idea of the content that will be covered in the docs.  Note that this is expected to change (possibly drastically), before the first stable release of Kraken is ready.  This site will be accompanied by a set of ready-to-run example projects that I will keep updated with the latest runtime.

## GitHub Details

The source for Kraken Engine is now hosted on [Github repo](https://github.com/KrakenEngine/kraken) in a ['Kraken Engine' GitHub Organization](https://github.com/krakenengine) to keep the various repositories organized together.  The source of this site and the main [krakenengine.com](https://krakenengine.com) site will be hosted there as well.  I am not looking for additional contributors until the Kraken codebase is a bit more stable; however, PR's, issues, and any other kind of feedback is always greatly appreciated.  If you have branched Kraken and would like to upstream some changes, please reach out to me at <kearwood@kearwood.com>.

## Jekyll Theme

This site is being built in [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) using the [Documentation Theme for Jeckyll](http://idratherbewriting.com/documentation-theme-jekyll/).  This amazing work by [Tom Johnson](http://idratherbewriting.com/aboutme/) and the Jekyll folks has made it so easy to get such a robust site up quickly.

## Next Up

Stay tuned as I start to fill in the sections of these docs one by one.  I look forward to your reviews and feedback so we can make Kraken Engine more useful to everyone.
